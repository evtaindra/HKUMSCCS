    <string name="about_leaderwelcome">We are living in the era where technology is widely accepted and becomes so commonplace that we doubt how we ever live without it. Mobile is a good prominent example. From businesses to individual consumers, everyone is connected to everyone, everywhere, all the time. Every day we hear of new technological breakthroughs, e.g. self-driving cars, organ-on-a-chip, smart glasses, drones; they are awe-inspiring. To remain in the game, the best IT professionals strive to maintain current knowledge and skills to take on these continual developments.\n\n
    The Master of Science in Computer Science Programme is a comprehensive and challenging graduate programme with three specialisations and one general stream, namely Financial Computing Stream, Cyber Security Stream, Multimedia Computing Stream and General Computer Science Stream, to meet the needs of both industry and business in Asia, and to make the programme more unique among comparable programmes in the region.\n\n
    As you can see from our curriculum, on one hand we have retained the nuts and bolts subjects to lay a strong foundation. But on the other hand, we updated and revised the curriculum continuously as we assess the career trends and needs of our students, and monitor rapid changes in technology developments. For example, hot topics like “fintech”, “blockchain” are included in some of our courses.\n\n
    If you like the holistic approach of our teaching methods and curriculum, please consider enrolling in this established programme in a world-class university.\n\n\n\n

    high-quality education and training of computing professionals at both the
    undergraduate and postgraduate levels. At the postgraduate level, we offer two taught
    programmes based on coursework, the MSc(CompSc) and the MSc(ECom and IComp), as well as
    the research-based MPhil and PhD programmes.\n\n

The academic staff is active in research and development in a variety of areas including
    databases, parallel and distributed computing, computer networks, computer graphics,
    algorithms and complexity, computer vision, multimedia, software engineering,
    statistical computing, information security and computer forensics, and legal
    aspects of computing. Some of our research results have been applied to the
    development of real software and systems. You will have these researchers as your
    inspiring teachers of the courses in this programme. Here are some of them.

    <string name="admission_ourstudents1">Words from Students</string>
    <string name="admission_ourstudents2">When you enrol in the MSc(CompSc) Programme, you gain all the advantages of a famous university with an outstanding reputation. When you leave our Programme, you will have a solid foundation in the theoretical aspect of computer science, together with hands-on technical experience in information technology, to help you begin a rewarding career.\n\nBut a master’s programme does not have to be the last chapter of your learning merely technical, hard-core information technology; it can serve as a springboard to other career opportunities and learning challenges. For example, many of our graduates who find themselves moving into management, may continue their studies towards an MBA degree, while others may go on to doctoral studies here at HKU or elsewhere.\n\nSome of our students and graduates would also like to share their experience with you.\n</string>
    <string name="admission_clarkwords">After studying and working for several years in the United States, I chose to do my Master degree at HKU based on the sterling reputation that the University and the CS programme have around the world. Having the flexibility to design my own studies and select interesting courses as well as having the opportunity to learn from top professors really appealed to me. The coursework was challenging yet fulfilling, and topics were relevant for today fast-changing world. I have been able to work with cutting-edge robotic systems during my dissertation project, and I am excited to begin a new career in the technology field armed with my MSc from HKU.</string>
    <string name="admission_cuiyitongwords">Studying in HKU MSc(CompSc) has prepared me for success in a couple of ways.  First, MSc(CompSc) offers a range of courses tailored to meet the specific academic and professional goals of each student.  Most of the hot topics are involved, such as Machine Learning, Data Mining, Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, Blockchain technology, etc.  When I do job-hunting, I find the courses have really offered help to me down-to-earth.  The programme also gives me much resources of knowledge and job opportunities.  Second, the strict requirements of each course induce me to be hard-working all the time, and provide me with many advanced learning skills.  The teamwork tasks gave me opportunity to know more about my classmates, who are down-to-earth and humble.\n\nCountless sleepless nights in HKU MSc(CompSc)  made me a better person.  It was an incredible experience that I don't think I could have anywhere else.</string>
    <string name="admission_hutianyiwords">In the past year, I benefit a lot from tough courses in this program, which makes up my deficiency in coding experience and brings me edge-cutting knowledge. Meanwhile, the design of four streams helps me concentrate on the study of computational finance. Comparing with programs in other universities, I think numerous opportunities provided by this program is a great advantage. Some teachers are from teaching staff with strong research experience while others are from industry with enrich working experience, meaning that communicating with them positively can bring us extra benefits. Furthermore, thanks to the reputation of the University of Hong Kong, we have access to many competitions, one of which is Rotman International Trading Competition held in Toronto competing with other top universities among the world. Through those competitions, I make friends with experienced algo traders and they also teach me much beyond the book, which enhance my will to work in this industry. \n\nAll in all, this program is really fruitful, and students from different background can get what they want. But the study period is short, I think designing the study plan on first day is important and necessary. Just be open and outgoing, the precious opportunity is around us.</string>
    <string name="admission_leelitongwords">There are a wide range of courses to choose from - AI, cybersecurity and financial computing to name a few. The course contents are up to date and HKU provides quality resources so that the learning process is smooth and unhindered.  The best part about the MSc programme is perhaps the people that you meet - I’ve made many friends with similar interest and drive.  We also have down-to-earth professors who are willing to dedicate time and effort to introduce current concepts and topics relevant to the industry.  On top of having a rigorous and well laid out curriculum, studying at HKU gives me an enjoyable and dynamic student life.  I am able to easily meet people entering or already working in the tech industry and I’m also able to practice and learn both Cantonese and Mandarin due to the diversity of students.  Lastly, Hong Kong provides a fun and safe place to study and is ideally located to immerse oneself into what is perhaps the world’s largest and most sophisticated mecca of technology - the Greater Bay Area."</string>
